### What is Universal Trakt Sync?

An extension that allows you to sync your TV shows and movies watching history from your favorite streaming services to Trakt.tv.

### Why do I need this extension?

If you want to sync from Netflix, this is the only Trakt.tv [plugin](https://trakt.tv/apps) that does it. In the future, we'll be adding support for more streaming services, so it will also serve as a single extension that works for multiple services.

### Which streaming services are supported?

- Netflix
- NRK
- Viaplay

### How does the extension work?

It extracts information about the TV shows / movies that you have watched watching by scraping the page and sends the data to Trakt using the [Trakt API](https://trakt.docs.apiary.io/).

### Known Issues

- The extension does not work well with Firefox containers, so if you use them, make sure that you are logged in to your Trakt / Netflix accounts in the no-container.
- When you stop watching something on Netflix, try not to immediately close the tab / window. Using the "Back to Browse" button or pausing first is preferable, because then the extension is able to detect that you have stopped watching. If you simply close the tab / window, the extension will keep scrobbling the item.
- Make sure you are logged into Streaming Services before trying to sync history content.

### Other Problems

If you find any other problems or have suggestions or questions, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/trakt-tools/universal-trakt-sync/issues/new).

### Development

1. Create an application in the [Trakt API](https://trakt.tv/oauth/applications/new) (don't forget to check the `/scrobble` permission).
2. In `Redirect uri:`, put `https://trakt.tv/apps`.
3. In `Javascript (cors) origins:`, put `moz-extension://` and `chrome-extension://`.
4. Copy the `config.dev.json` example file and change the Trakt.tv credentials.

```bash
cp config.dev.json config.json
```

5. Use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to run the correct version of Node.js.

```bash
nvm use
```

6. Install the dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

- To run in development mode:

```bash
npm start
```

- To get the build version for development mode (does not watch files):

```bash
npm run build-dev
```

- To get the build version for production mode (generates app.zip, ready for deployment):

```bash
npm run build
npm run zip
```

####How to add more streaming services

- Make sure that the serivce you want to add actually has a rest API.
- Add hostname/domain to permissions in manifest in `webpack.config.js`.
- Copy one the existing services in `src/modules/history/streaming-services/`. Netflix is the most complex one.
- The Page- and Store-files should be fairly easy to update. Probably just the name as all logic is in the inherited classes.
- As a TypeScript project, interfaces of rest APIs should be declared in `src/typedefs.d.ts`.
- All APIs have different aspects and limitations, updates may be needed elsewhere in the sourcecode to handle these cases.

### Credits

This extension is based on [traktflix](https://github.com/tegon/traktflix), the original Netflix sync developed by [tegon](https://github.com/user/tegon), which was discontinued in favor of Universal Trakt Sync.
